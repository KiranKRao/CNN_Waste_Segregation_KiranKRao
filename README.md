# Waste Segregation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste images into different categories for waste segregation purposes.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

Proper waste segregation is crucial for recycling and waste management. This notebook trains a CNN model to automatically classify waste images (e.g., plastic, metal, glass, paper, organic) to assist in efficient waste sorting.
